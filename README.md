This repository contains a from-scratch implementation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), Ho, J., Jain, A., & Abbeel, P. (2020) in Pytorch. It uses a U-Net architecture for denoising. No classifier guidance, latent space compression, or acceleration tricksâ€”just basic diffusion as described in the DDPM paper.
