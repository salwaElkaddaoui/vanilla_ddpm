# vanilla_ddpm
This repository contains a from-scratch implementation of Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) using Pytorch. It uses a U-Net architecture for denoising. No classifier guidance, latent space compression, or acceleration tricksâ€”just vanilla diffusion as described in the DDPM paper.
